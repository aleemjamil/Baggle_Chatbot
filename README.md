# Baggle Chatbot

Welcome to the **Baggle Chatbot**! This project is a chatbot designed to provide real-time product information and engage users with interactive conversations on the **Baggle.com** website.

The Baggle Chatbot is built using **Flask** for the backend and integrates with the Baggle product database to provide users with detailed, up-to-date information about products, promotions, and more. It leverages real-time data from Baggle.com to ensure accurate and dynamic responses to customer queries.

## Features

- **Real-Time Product Information**: The chatbot can provide up-to-date information on products available on Baggle.com.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Users can chat with the bot in natural language, asking about product details, specifications, prices, availability, and more.
- **Seamless Integration**: The chatbot is integrated into the Baggle.com website, providing an easy and interactive shopping experience.
- **Personalized Responses**: The chatbot uses intelligent algorithms to respond to user queries in a way that mimics human conversation.
- **Product Recommendations**: Based on user input, the chatbot can recommend products that meet specific criteria or preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Flask** (for backend server and REST API handling)
  - **Python** (for backend logic)
  - WebSocket or HTTP for real-time communication
  
- **Frontend**:
  - JavaScript (React, Vue, or any frontend framework of choice)
  - HTML/CSS (for chatbot UI design)

- **Chatbot Engine**:
  - [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) or [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) (for natural language processing)
  - Custom bot logic to fetch product data and integrate with Baggle's backend
  
- **Database**:
  - Product data (can be pulled from Baggle's existing product database or API)
  
- **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - External APIs for real-time data fetching

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Baggle Chatbot locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** and **pip** (for managing Python dependencies)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for frontend dependencies)
- A web browser to interact with the chatbot
- API access to Baggle's product database (if necessary)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/baggle-chatbot.git
   cd baggle-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**:

   Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend** (if applicable):

   Navigate to the `client` directory and install the necessary frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or follow the template in `.env.example`) and configure your environment variables, such as API keys, product database URLs, etc.

5. **Run the backend**:

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Run the frontend** (if applicable):

   Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

7. Open the website or `localhost` in your browser to interact with the Baggle Chatbot!

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, users can begin chatting with the bot directly on the Baggle.com website. It supports various user queries, including but not limited to:

- **Product Information**: "Tell me about the latest smartphones"
- **Availability**: "Is the Apple iPhone 15 in stock?"
- **Product Features**: "What are the features of the Samsung Galaxy S21?"
- **Price Information**: "How much does the Nike Air Max cost?"
- **Recommendations**: "Can you recommend a laptop under $1000?"

The chatbot will respond based on real-time data pulled from Baggle's product database.

### Key Changes:
- Updated the **Backend** section to reflect the use of **Flask** for the server-side logic.
- In the **Installation** section, added instructions for setting up a Python virtual environment and installing Flask dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- Slightly adjusted phrasing throughout to make it clear that you're using **Flask** as the backend framework.

This should now be more aligned with the Flask-based backend for your project!
